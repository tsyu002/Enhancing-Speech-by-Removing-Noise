# Enhancing-Speech-by-Removing-Noise

In the Enhancing Speech by Removing Noise project, IIR and FIR low pass filters are designed to remove noise and enhance the speech signal of interest. A noisy signal stored in variable noisy and sampled at 44,100 Hz was provided. The signal was a summation of speech signal bandlimited at 4 kHz using a low pass filter and noise signal filtered at 4 kHz using a high pass filter. The following parameters were given:

1.                Passband edge: 2500 Hz.
2.                Stopband edge: 4000 Hz.
3.                Maximum gain in the passband: 40 dB.
4.                Minimum gain in the passband: 37 dB.
5.                Maximum gain in the stopband: 55 dB.

Discrete time filters of the Butterworth, Chebyshev Type I, Chebyshev Type II, Elliptic, Parks-McClellan, and Kaiser type were designed.
